# My Flask REST API

## Description

A simple Python REST API application for stores and items belong to the store. In this application user can add number of stores and each store can have multiple items. Also the user have to authorize themselves to access the endpoints. This application is deployed on both Linux server and Heroku.

I used SQLAlchemy to work with relational database and later implemented the PostgreSQL.

## Implementation

This project is implemented using Flask, and is a REST API for a store. This code works on both Linux server and Heroku. Used Postman to test the endpoints.

## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
